What started as a 3 month project to promote the first ever #trulondon, became a permanent online entity for Bill Boorman ([@BillBoorman](https://twitter.com/BillBoorman)) and the space in which he’d post all about the things he’s currently thinking and feeling about recruiting, technology, HR and social media.

Bill Boorman is the man in the hat and founder of the #tru Recruiting Unconference. He’s worked in the recruiting space for the last 30 years and is best known for his norm challenging ideas based on the philosophy “_It’s about skills and what people can do, not what bits of paper they have. it is not about job titles. Go look for people, not for CVs_“.
