Tomorrow’s recruiters will be creative marketers, able to effectively market candidates, jobs, their organizations and themselves through a variety of online a offline channels. **They will be brand champions**, at ease working up and down and inside/outside their organizations. They must be technically fluent and know how to wrangle metrics to develop actionable strategies, ones that are nimble and **can rapidly pivot with the business.  
**  
They will understand what social media is, what it isn’t, and how to effectively incorporate it into various programs (recruiting, branding, talent communities, etc). Technology is oftentimes the focus of futuristic, sometimes dystopian, talks, and rightly so. But still leading to the notion that **technology will not hurt recruitment opportunities for the future, but better them.**The act of recruiting is becoming **far more tech demanding** and recruiters will need to be able **to be technically fluent** to source candidates. While data mining and utilizing big data is becoming integral, a recruiter’s contractor book and ability to network is still what will hold sway.

I think that, as recruitment is becoming more important and visible within organizations, we will see **it becoming more analytical and systematic.** As recruitment has become more important and visible, competitive pressures will require the planning and decision making capability of recruiting organizations to improve significantly.

Data is making our lives easier these days and so it does for recruiters and companies as well. **Social data** and the increase in use of technology **have changed recruiting once more.** It gives recruiters more insights into a candidate’s history as well as the ability to analyze a person’s skills, knowledge and work. **Back-end matching, algorithms and data analysis will make our lives easier** in the future find the right candidates even faster.

In the **time of war for talent**, the best candidates will always have different options. Today’s generation has different values and wants to know how they can contribute to make the world a better place by taking the job. The recruiting **world is changing fast** and recruiters need to be adaptable, **driven and curious** to keep up with the pace. More channels have become available to find and attract talent faster. **Recruiting** is and will be an opportunity game, **which means it stays at a fast pace.**
