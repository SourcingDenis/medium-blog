## Win the job by considering these insightful tips

![](./asset-1.jpeg)

What seems like such a simple question can really make you sweat, especially in an interview. What, exactly, should you share — **not just to build rapport**, but to **show that you’re the perfect fit for the job**?

Your response to this request will set the tone for the rest of the interview. For some, this is **the most challenging question to answer**, as they wonder what the interviewer really wants to know and what information they should include.

When an interviewer says, “Tell me about yourself,” the interviewer wants information that is **pertinent to the job you’re interviewing for.**

**A formula** I really like to use is called the **Present-Past-Future formula.** So, first you start with the present — where you are right now. Then, segue into the past — a little bit about the experiences you’ve had and the skills you gained at the previous position. Finally, finish with the future — why you are really excited for this particular opportunity.

### **Transition to Professional from Personal**

After sharing a few interesting personal aspects of your background, you can transition to sharing some **key professional skills** that would help you to add value if you were hired for your target job.

#### **Follow your script**

Prepare a script that includes the information you want to convey. Begin by talking about past experiences and proven success.

### **Share Your Expertise 😎**

Be ready to share three or four of the personal qualities, skills and/or areas of expertise which would help you to excel in the job for which you are interviewing. Ultimately, you will want to share several other strengths before the interview is over.

Make a **list of your strengths** before you go into the interview, so you know what you will share. Look at the job description and match it with your skills. Then share the top few skills which make you an ideal candidate for the job.

### **Practice 🤓**

Practice with your script until you **feel confident about what you want to emphasize** in your statement. Your script should help you stay on track, but you shouldn’t memorize it — you don’t want to sound stiff and rehearsed. It should sound **natural and conversational.**

Remember throughout your answer to focus on the experiences and skills that are going to be most relevant for the hiring manager when they’re thinking about this particular position and this company. And ultimately, **don’t be afraid to relax a little bit**, tell stories and anecdotes — the hiring manager already has your resume, so they also want to know a little more about you. **There is no need** to discuss spouses, partners, children, or any other **strictly personal information.**
