Keeping up with technology **is not an easy feat.** And neither is getting around to it. However, it’s paramount if you want to source and attract top tech talent. Thankfully, there is a ton of tools available that are **exceedingly helpful.** The [**Chrome Extension GlossaryTech for LinkedIn**](https://glossarytech.com/plugin) is one of them.

Originally intended for **sourcing technical talent on LinkedIn**, the extension can also be used to learn programming terms on any website, e.g. **GitHub, StackOverflow, Wikipedia**, etc. The extension **detects and highlights** tech terms on a web page, provides their clear, concise definitions, as well as allows to **filter the terms by category (Front-end, Back-end, QA, etc).**

### Here’s a detailed guide on how-to use it:

-   [**Install**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/glossarytech-for-linkedin/lkfaknngnekohfmljebdikgefjfhkgkp?hl=en) the plug-in from the Chrome Web Store. It’s absolutely **FREE.**
-   Go to the LinkedIn profile you’re interested in. **Click on the extension icon** **to detect tech terms** included in the profile.

**_NOTE:_** _The icon will keep you informed when a tech term has been detected._

#### To filter the terms by category, use the sidebar. For this, just click the icon in the ribbon. **Each category has its own color.**

#### Besides, there’s a **_“Terms”_** tab in the sidebar (see above). Switch to it if you want to explore the technical terms detected in more detail.
